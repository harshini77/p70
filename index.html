                <p class="text-muted text-left">During recent years there has been a rapidly growing demand on the part of the public for the use of the school building as a community centers for all kinds of cultural and educational activities. It is recognized that t4te responsibility of the public school does not end with the education of children through high school but must be extended so as to make available educational find recreational opportunities for both youth and adults. This means that the school building should be planned so as to provide the facilities needed for both school and after-school activities

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Every school has a canteen and it makes it easy for students to get food from these canteens.
On a busy day when mothers don’t get time to pack lunchboxes or snack boxes, these canteens are really handy and a lifesaver.Our school also has a canteen. The canteen is very big and could accommodate many students at a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in school.Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates. The canteen at our school would almost be full on all days. Many students come there to have their food.

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Online Attendance (Virtual Attendance) lets you keep an attendance track of all your students by tracking their log in’s and off’s. It is beneficial for educators as it helps them to monitor learners’ entire scholastic activities accurately. In Offline attendance, attendance is marked in traditional way using attendance register books.HOW IT WORKS? 1  School admin schedules timetable for virtual classes.
                2 Teachers login through Teacher App, whereas, students login through Parent App.
    3 Virtual attendance is tracked by the system with respect to their Log in’s and off’s.
4 Time spent on Assignment and Assessment, e-learning etc are also tracked collectively by the system.
